            <p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After attending several colleges around
            the area, I relocated to Southern California to study Finance at California State University at
            Fullerton. I worked for several years managing the financial books and offices of several design
            and construction businesses.
            </p>
            <p>After relocating to Austin, Texas with my husband Tim, I shifted my focus toward our growing a family. We now have two beautiful children as well as a collection of pets (including chickens!). I
            stayed busy working part-time contract bookkeeping until deciding to switch fields in 2018.
            </p>   
            <p>I am currently learning full stack web development at The UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. I believe my natural love of creativity, knack for building and fixing, and attention to small details makes for a perfect fit in the ever-growing world of software development.
