            <p>Katie was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After attending several colleges around
            the area, she relocated to Southern California to study Finance at California State University at
            Fullerton. Katie worked for several years managing the financial books and offices of several design
            and construction businesses.
            </p>
            <p>After relocating to Austin, Texas with her husband Tim, Katie shifted her focus to her growing family. Katie and Tim now have two beautiful children, as well as a collection of pets (including chickens!). Katie
            continued working part-time bookkeeping jobs during this time, until eventually deciding to switch fields.
            </p>   
            <p>As of November 2018, Katie is currently a student of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. Her love of complex puzzles, challenges
            and technology makes for a perfect fit in this new field!
